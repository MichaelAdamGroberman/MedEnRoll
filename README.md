# MedEnRoll


## Who is the User?
 

The user is the patient and the doctor’s office.



## How is it going to benefit the user?


Will help overcome the inefficiencies related to paperwork and time-management while making the doctor’s appointments. 


## What data do we need to capture?


Basic login information which would include the user's first name, last name, address, email id, etc.


Detailed information about the medical history of the person


## How does the data need to be processed?

 

We will use MongoDB, Mongoose to process the data.


We will be parsing and propagating values from the JSON object to the UI (user interface)

 

## User Story

As a patient/medical owner 

I want to be able to view and manage the 

 

patient information/doctor’s office information, appointments, and upcoming schedule

 

So that I can organize and plan my day/business. 

 

## Acceptance Criteria 

1.    Users should be able to sign up into the app using their name, email id, and password.

 

2.    They will be able to access a list of medical providers to make the appointment.

 

 

Going forward they should be able to log into the app that links them directly to that particular doctor’s office. 

 

3.              Once the user makes an appointment they should be able to access their past and upcoming appointments.

 

4.              The user will then be asked to fill out forms for their detailed medical history, the information is stored in their personal database for use by the doctor.

 

5.              The user should also be able to add their personal sensitive information such as medical insurances, member ids. 

 

6.              When the user selects a date, time, and place for the appointment, an email and SMS notification is sent to the user and doctor’s office. 

 

 

 

 

## Ideas for Future Development 

 

When the user visits the doctor, an invoice is automatically generated.

Stripe for credit card info/interchangeable with a different payment processor integration. 

 

Use data to generate reports and projections to preempt any complications in health in the future.

 

Send email/SMS reminders automatically.

 

The patient can exchange direct messages with the doctor.
